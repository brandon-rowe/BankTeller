<h2>Title: Bank Teller</h2>
<p>This project is an operating system design to simulate a bank teller. 
We will be using a RasberryPi with a touchscreen to give users the ability to create and delete accounts,
deposit/withdraw or check their balance, check transaction history, log interactions, and maintain account 
information and passwords.</p>
